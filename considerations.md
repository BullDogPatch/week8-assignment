### Considerations

- Create a SQL schema for a posts table and a comments table, with the comments being connected to the posts table with a foreign key. ✅
- Display all posts on the page. ✅
- Create a form which saves comments to a dedicated comments table, with the comments being connected to the posts table with a foreign key. ✅
- Create a delete button on posts that allows users to delete the post from the database. ✅
- Allow users to comment on individual posts in their dynamic routes. Comments should be associated with posts, and have a dynamic route (e.g. `/posts/:postid`). ✅
- Add a redirect when a user creates a post to redirect them to the posts page. ✅
- Have an option to sort them in ascending or descending order. (only basic asc to desc, like the one in the demo. Hope that is good enough) ✅
